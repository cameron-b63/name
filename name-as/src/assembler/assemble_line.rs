/*

I can understand that this assemble function may at first seem to be kind of a behemoth. 

The logic is as follows:
- Break each line into its components and specify by type what needs to happen for each component
- If an instruction was present, retrieve its information from the constant table
- If registers/immediates/identifiers are provided, push them to an arguments vector
- If symbols are encountered, attempt to resolve them. If unresolvable, save them to the environment's backpatches for fixing later.
- After all this is said and done, call the assemble_instruction helper with the arguments and symbol table if an instruction was present
- Instead, if a directive was present, call the appropriate handler.
- Update tracking variables (line_number, current_address, etc.) appropriately
