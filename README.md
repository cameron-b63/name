# NAME

![logo](logo/logo.png)

NAME ("Not Another MIPS Emulator") is a modular, language-agnostic assembly code emulation pipeline designed for educational use.

## Goals

NAME accomplishes a modular approach to assembly code emulation by dividing and conquering three crucial elements:

1. **Assembling** - accomplished by [name-as](name-as), a configurable assembler framework 
2. **Emulation** - accomplished by [name-emu](name-emu), an extensible framework for developing CPU emulators
3. **Development** - accomplished by 
  - [name-ext](name-ext), a VSCode integration for assembly development complete with a [DAP](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol//) and [IntelliSense](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense) for insight into emulated CPU cores
  - [name-fmt](name-fmt) a VSCode extension for canonical assembly formatting

This branch contains the original state of the main branch of the project, as I received it. I will not be removing it for some time.
